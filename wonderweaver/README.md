this was a VERY old level editing tool thing for wonder before the actual editors existed(tool released very early on, and only supported editing a path)

heres the origonal description:

Im releasing some early stuff untill i can get everything packaged up into a blender plugin.
The really fancy looking previewer is not done, so for now, ill just be sending the import and export python files which are responsible for importing all of the points and exporting them.
right now they export and import from export.xml in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Blender (or wherever the blender exe is). this issue will be fixed later before the actual release.

To use it, take a ground path from the level, and add <root></root> around it like the example file im sending after the py files.

This is extremely unfinished but i need to sleep so ill post the full thing hopefully tomorrow or the day after and i would recommend not using this thing yet. also the py files could probably be repurposed to help an actual full level editor.
